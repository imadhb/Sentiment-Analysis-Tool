This Python script provides a straightforward way to analyze the sentiment of text using the TextBlob library. Sentiment analysis helps determine whether a piece of text expresses positive, negative, or neutral emotions.

The tool allows users to input text and receive a sentiment analysis result. It supports various languages by automatically detecting and translating text if needed. The analysis result includes a sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) and a sentiment score, ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), with 0 indicating neutrality.

To use the tool, simply clone or download the repository, install the TextBlob library (if not already installed), and run the script. Follow the prompts to input your text and optionally specify the language.
